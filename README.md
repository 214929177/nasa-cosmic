# NASA-Cosmic

######  A dump of some of the NASA developed code from the COSMIC archive
	
NASA was one of the first labs to share the code developed internally; it was done through a web portal called COSMIC at the University of Georgia. COSMIC was closed down in 1998, but a set of boxed CD-ROMs from the long-gone Pacific Hi-Tech with a more or less complete set of source code directories was found.
It contains mainly fortran 77 codes, some of which may be of interest to engineers.
Packages were obtained "as is" by Pacific Hi-Tech, and it seems that they were distributed as public domain after payment of copying costs.

#### Note

This project was originally hosted on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/nasa-cosmic/), but was moved to github after the shutdown was announced.  This fork is simply a continuation of that data.  I do have information for person who originally uploaded the data if someone would like to make contact.

I'm not sure on the state of the code, but I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't all build.  It'd be neat to get it working on an up-to-date compiler.


#### License

The license on Google Code was listed as GPL v2, but given it was public domain, I think it should still be public domain.  Still, if you have commits that could/should be incorporated, feel free to submit them.
